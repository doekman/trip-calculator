integer.explosed rewrite
========================

This is the [NoTemplate-version][notemplate] of FuelApp, in response to [this toot](https://mastodon.decentralised.social/@wezm/113081831357842415).

I just wanted to see how [arrow.js](https://www.arrow-js.com) works, and see how this will be different with the NoTemplate-library.

I did a similar thing with [Integer Exposed][int_exp], thought that used Vue.
